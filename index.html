                    <p>Hello! My name is Darryl Tolentino and I am a native Bay Area resident from San Mateo County that is currently a student at UC Berkeley Extension for Web Development. I work primarily in Video Game Development and hope to utilize the knowledge of Web Development to make me a more versatile coder to employers within the game industry.</p>
                    <p>I love watching anime and sports and I love playing video games in my spare time. My favorite teams are the Golden State Warriors(basketball), San Francisco 49ers(American football), San Francisco Giants(baseball), San Jose Sharks(hockey), and the Borussia Dortmund(soccer). Please contact me if you have any questions!</p>
